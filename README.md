# Face-Feature-Analysis-using-DL
This was my project during the research internship in <i>Computational Liguistics Lab, PICT</i>.

#### Check <strong>"Documents/Internship-Report"<strong> for the details regarding the internship and my project.

#### Brief:-
* This project is purely based on Computer Vision.
* I used Tensorflow-Keras in this project.
* The models trained were also ran to check results on a realtime footage captured through my laptop webcam.
* Although the internship and it's outcome is complete, I am still working on a modified problem statement of this same project in order to publish a research paper on the emotion-analysis topic.
