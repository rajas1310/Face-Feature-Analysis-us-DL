# Face-Feature-Analysis-using-DL
This was my work during the research internship at <i>Computational Liguistics Lab, PICT</i> in my junior year.

#### Check <strong>"Documents/Internship-Report"<strong> for the details regarding the internship and my project.

#### Brief:-
* This project is based on Computer Vision. I used Tensorflow-Keras in this project.
* The models trained were also ran to check results on a realtime footage captured through a webcam.
* This CV module is planned to be a part of a PhD-level project aimed at developing a multi-modal depression analysis system.
* Although this work is elementary, it played a crucial part by allowing me to explore and learn working with DL frameworks while also gave me foundational understanding about Computer Vision and DL.
